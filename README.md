'coords_SLiM_GCF_000247815.1_FicAlb1.5_chr12.txt' is the chromosome map

'out_rho4Ne_win2e+05_col.hun.snpPair_runALL_chr12.txt' is a recombination linkage map

'1773-1997.rar' contains habitat suitability maps used in the second simulation file

'Alessandro_burnin_v2_21_05_21.slim' is the initial simulation that runs with a stable habitat to generate mutations to fill the chromosome. 
The state of this simulation is then imported into 'PintoCollapseReplicates.slim', which runs replicates of the habitat loss scenario and outputs genomic data.

'MauritiusForestDecline.mp4' is a visual representation of the habitat loss scenario.
